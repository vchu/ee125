#EE125 Topology Log

= Introduction =

Here is the log for our progress on the project

10-30-2008 - first setup
Have two cameras in lab (Trung has another one at home)
Replaced the switch with a wireless router
Installed OpenCV - has to be 1.0 because 1.1 is missing cvcam
Installed Visual Studio 2005 - Careful about it not being backwards compatible with 2008 files
Setup wireless router to be able to remote into computers
Opened up project and was able to compile and build on all computers


Note: If cannot remote into computer need to ping the computer first

We installed SVN onto all the local computers and Trung set up google server to hold code

11-6-2008 : INTERNETS!
Have one laptop connect wirelessly to the internet
Have that laptop share it's internet
    1. Go to Network Connections
    2. Go to Properties for wireless
    3. Advanced - Allow other netowrk users to connect
If you cannot get both wireless and lan connection check for combatibility mode
on your wireless card by using command prompt
    1. Type "netsh bridge show" and then type:
    2. "netsh bridge set a # e" where number is the number that showed up as wireless
        from previous command

Then connect your computer to the WAN port of the router and make sure it grabs an IP
TADA internets!

- We then downloaded all the code onto the computers

#EE125 Topology Log

= Introduction =

Here is the log for our progress on the project

==10-30-2008 - first setup==
Have two cameras in lab (Trung has another one at home)
Replaced the switch with a wireless router
Installed OpenCV - has to be 1.0 because 1.1 is missing cvcam
Installed Visual Studio 2005 - Careful about it not being backwards compatible with 2008 files
Setup wireless router to be able to remote into computers
Opened up project and was able to compile and build on all computers


Note: If cannot remote into computer need to ping the computer first

==10-31-2008==
We installed SVN onto all the local computers and Trung set up google server to hold code

==11-6-2008 : INTERNETS==
Have one laptop connect wirelessly to the internet
Have that laptop share it's internet
    1. Go to Network Connections
    2. Go to Properties for wireless
    3. Advanced - Allow other netowrk users to connect
If you cannot get both wireless and lan connection check for combatibility mode
on your wireless card by using command prompt
    1. Type "netsh bridge show" and then type:
    2. "netsh bridge set a # e" where number is the number that showed up as wireless
        from previous command

Then connect your computer to the WAN port of the router and make sure it grabs an IP
TADA internets!

- We then downloaded all the code onto the computers

==11-7-2008 : TCP/IP==
We were able to run the base code - proj.exe

We started to play around with TCP/IP code that we found online.  

*Note we should make sure we don't delete the important copyright items before it

==11-9-2008: Send==
We were able to create a Network class with function send:
   * This function input included the (ID, Data, Size);

Testing:
   * We were also able to run the server on one central computer and send it data from another computer as a "client" with actual data from the original camera input in Xmain

==11-12-2008: SendBytes and Recieive==
We decided that it would be safer and more effective to send bytes instead of dealing with a string.  Sadly it took us 2-3 hours to figure out how to use the recv API function correctly.  We ended up passing in a pointer incorrectly which caused an infinite loop.
   * No longer have the same format to send
   * 

We got SendBytes to work quickly and the rest of the time for receiveBytes.
   * ReceiveBytes takes in a variable len and r.  

==11-14-2008: Queues/Meeting==
Started to work on Queues and implementing on Server side.

Had meeting with Edgar.  He gave us the code/program for matlab that compiles data from the server into a pretty map interface

==11-17-2008: More Queues==
   * Got a working Queue
   * Implemented System calls to make directories and writing to files
   * Still working on making the proper header to make directories work properly
   * Edgar was there and helped mount cameras and make an "encoder" for the robot
   * Trung has a working PWM for the robot 


==11-19-2008: EntranceDetection test==
   * Got EntranceDetection code to work with server end. Temporarily commented out line 141 on {{{\HSN-Demo2\C-Server\_socket.cpp}}} because it wasn't allowing the rest of the code to compile. 
   * Edgar's sample data was processed as he showed us in his demo.
      * When you run the code, click on one of the 3 windows that open up and press any button on the keyboard.

==11-19-2008: Server Revamp==
   * Transferred test server and Socket to a new project and able to compile with Edgar's server project.  Included all mote functions including mote_comm (Need to think about how to properly remove mote_comm and replace with our sending/receive functions)
   * Fixed socket.cpp issue (just forgot to cast ><")
   * Got proper header and folder issues resolved.  Need to still think about adding pkgType to header

==11-20-2008: Server integration==
   * Split up the test server functions that were created earlier and put them in the new server.  One thread to receive threads and the other to parse.  
   * Ran into issues with the thread suddenly stopping?  Seems to hang instead of repeatedly looping.
